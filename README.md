# WhatsappBot
A whatsapp bot that sends scheduled messages.


# The Idea
The idea is to implement a reminder schedular with which the user can interact through whatsapp.
* The user schedules messages (CRUD operations)
* Server sends the messages as scheduled


# Use Case
Well personally the idea is just a virtual assistant that reminds me of tasks to accomplish.
For example: I want to be reminded me of the 3 'o' clock meeting a 2:45. So I can just schedule a message to be sent to me at 2:45 reminding me about the meeting via whatsapp.
For ease of use, the scheduling operation must be done via whatsapp too.


# Near Future
The best and the worst part about this idea according to me is the whatsapp part.
- The best part is that an ubiquitous messaging app acts as a remote controller for the application.
- The worst part being 'whatsapp'.

The most doable mitigation I can think of right now is switching to signal.


# Roots
This idea of mine was inspired by a two part video series titles "Hack.Me" by GLUG NIT Durgapur.
