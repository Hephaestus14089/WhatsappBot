# WhatsappBot
A whatsapp bot that sends scheduled messages.

# The Idea
The idea is to implement a reminder schedular with which the user can interact through whatsapp.
* The user schedules messages (CRUD operations)
* Server sends the messages as scheduled

# Use Case
Well personally the idea is just a virtual assistant that reminds me of tasks to accomplish.
For example: I want to be reminded me of the 3 'o' clock meeting a 2:45. So I can just schedule a message to be sent to me at 2:45 reminding me about the meeting via whatsapp.
For ease of use, the scheduling operation must be done via whatsapp too.

# Near Future
The best and the worst part about this idea according to me is the whatsapp part.
- The best part is that an ubiquitous messaging app acts as a remote controller for the application.
- The worst part being 'whatsapp'.

The doable mitigation would be switching to signal.

# Roots
This idea of mine was inspired by a video session of GLUG NIT Durgapur.
It was about an event schedular using Twilio, Python Flask, Google Calander and it also did use whatsapp as the means of communication between the user and the application.
